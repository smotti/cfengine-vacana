* Need to take a closer look at the inventory stuff
    * How does it differ from the host info report?
    * How can we laverage it?
    * They mentioned using bundlesmatching/valuesmatching when using it
      with the community edition, but how?
	* Maybe make some tests with it
* Take a look at the lastseen stuff
    * There's also a tool/script from Mark to read them directly from the db
    * And there's also a tool i think to dump the database(s)
